# 🔐 SecureSpend – Credit Card Fraud Detection System

**SecureSpend** is a machine learning-based web app that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using anonymized transaction features and advanced resampling techniques. It provides real-time fraud predictions through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Uses **Random Forest Classifier** for fraud detection
- 🧮 Incorporates **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance
- 📊 Scales transaction amounts with `StandardScaler`
- 🧪 Accepts PCA-transformed features (V1–V28)
- 🖥️ Built with an intuitive **Streamlit interface**

## 📁 Project Structure

- ├── credit_train.py # Trains the fraud detection model
- ├── credit_test.py # Streamlit app for real-time prediction
- ├── credit_preprocess.py # Cleans data, applies scaling + SMOTE
- ├── fraud_model.pkl # Trained fraud detection model
- ├── cscaler.pkl # Scaler for 'Amount' normalization
- ├── preprocessed_fraud.csv # Resampled and preprocessed dataset

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Streamlit
- Joblib

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Preprocessing (`credit_preprocess.py`)
   - Loads dataset and drops missing values
   - Scales the transaction `Amount` field
   - Uses **SMOTE** to address class imbalance
   - Saves preprocessed dataset as `preprocessed_fraud.csv`

2. Model Training (`credit_train.py`)
   - Splits dataset into training and testing sets
   - Trains a **Random Forest model** (or Logistic Regression)
   - Evaluates accuracy and classification metrics
   - Saves model to `fraud_model.pkl`

3. Fraud Prediction UI (`credit_test.py`)
   - Accepts `Amount` and PCA features (V1 to V28) from user
   - Scales and formats inputs
   - Predicts whether a transaction is **genuine or fraudulent**

## 💻 How to Run the App

### 1. Clone the Repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/securespend.git
cd securespend

### 2. Install Requirements
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit joblib imbalanced-learn

### 3. Train the Model
python credit_train.py
(This will automatically preprocess data and generate the model)

### 4. Launch the Streamlit App
streamlit run credit_test.py

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Real-time fraud screening for online payments
- Bank/Fintech transaction monitoring
- Data science portfolio showcasing classification & imbalance handling
